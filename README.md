# Incorrect Usage of $in Operator in MongoDB Queries

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries.  The `$in` operator is used to check if a field's value exists in an array.  However, improper usage can lead to incorrect query results.

## Bug Description
The bug arises from an incorrect understanding or application of how the `$in` operator works with different data types and structures within MongoDB documents.  The incorrect usage can cause the query to either return unintended documents or fail altogether.

## Bug Solution
The solution demonstrates the correct usage of the `$in` operator, ensuring it matches the expected data types and correctly filters documents.

## How to Reproduce the Bug
1.  Set up a MongoDB instance and populate it with sample documents.  The specific structure of the document is irrelevant to this demonstration, so a simple structure is used.
2. Execute the code in `bug.js` to observe the incorrect behavior.
3. Execute the code in `bugSolution.js` to see the correct implementation.

This example emphasizes the importance of carefully considering data types and structures when working with MongoDB query operators.
